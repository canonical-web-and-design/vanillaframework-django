# django-with-yaml codebase

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/canonical-websites/django-with-yaml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ubuntudesign/django-with-yaml)

This is the codebase and content for [django-with-yaml](https://django-with-yaml), a simple databaseless informational website project based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Bugs and issues

Found a bug or have an idea for a new feature? Feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/django-with-yaml/issues/new), or suggest a fix by [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Local development

The simplest way to run the site locally is to first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), add your user to the `docker` group, and then use the `./run` script:

``` bash
./run
```

Once the containers are setup, you can visit <http://127.0.0.1:8000> in your browser.

### Building CSS

For working on [Sass files](static/css), you may want to dynamically watch for changes to rebuild the CSS whenever something changes.

To setup the watcher, open a new terminal window and run:

``` bash
./run watch
```

For more detailed local development instructions, see [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).
